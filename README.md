Gratitude goes to the team at [ZURB](http://zurb.com/) for their excellent [Foundation CSS framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/); [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for the fantastic icon font; Pascal Finette for [The Heretic](http://theheretic.me), which I forked to make this.
