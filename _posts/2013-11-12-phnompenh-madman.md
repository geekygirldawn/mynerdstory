Before we get started, nobody panic. I gave the full account of the following to five people I would trust with my life before I finally went to sleep. I am safe.

In the words of my wise friend, Jessica Heinzleman, "Welcome to international work.  It is fraught with weirdos, wackos and some scary individuals." I've hit my halfway point of this journey, six weeks down, six more weeks to go and I'm just now running into someone fitting her description. We'll omit his name and the specific location and any other identifying details. Suffice to say, a boisterous asshole sidled up to the bar, inquiring in an Eastern bloc accent seasoned with five decades of tobacco "Are you one of those Americans who would be angry if I smoked." I replied "Sit down, have a cigarette and tell me a story." This isn't the first time the voice in my head that gleefully shrieks "this is going to be **the best story**" has gotten me in a scrape. We started off with him declaring that I had the best short haircut on a woman he'd seen in twenty years. If you can conjure this image, this man's man who later showed me his permit to carry a glock, his lined face giggling as he proclaimed French men to be the best hairdressers. 

What I hoped would be a charming asshole turned out to be a nasty combination of bully and bigot. Darkness descended with the second cocktail. He bragged that in his youth he'd killed people for fun. I asked what he does now for fun. "It's boring now." In a calm tone he reassured me that he "wouldn't keep you for myself. I'd sell you." Oh wow, this is good information for me to know. Than didn't scare me visibly, so then he moved onto threatening to revoke my visa, effective immediately. Fantastic. "That's fine, I'm happy to go back home." By this point, I was desperate for an exit path. When he went to the bathroom, one of the staff came over and told me he was a bad man and asked what I wanted to do. I've never been more impatient for a credit card to process. They ushered me out the side door into a waiting motorcycle taxi. I rode back to my apartment with head ducked below the seat.

I'm reassured that if he was a REALLY bad man, they would've put me in a car and taken me to safety. Nobody wants the international PR a disappeared American would bring. There is a US Consulate right in the middle of town. 

Another day, another story, another lesson. Till the next one, take care my friends.
