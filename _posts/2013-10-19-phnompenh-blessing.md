Wat Ounalom fronts the Mekong River, only blocks away from my apartment. This gentlemen gestured to the small inner pagoda. I undid the the padlock, turned on the light and indicated for me not to bump my head as I went in. Sticks and flinging water and a pulsing pink neon light behind the buddha's head were the ingredients for the blessing I didn't seek but was enchanted to receive.
