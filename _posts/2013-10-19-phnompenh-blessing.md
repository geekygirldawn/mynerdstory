Wat Ounalom, a large Buddhist temple, fronts the Mekong River only blocks away from my apartment. This gentlemen gestured to the small inner pagoda. He undid the the padlock, turned on the light and indicated for me not to bump my head as I went in. Sticks and flinging water and a pulsing pink neon light behind the Buddha's head were the ingredients for the blessing I didn't seek but was enchanted to receive.
