Thad, wearing an Angry Birds shirt matched smartly up with a skirt sewn of alternating Hello Kitty and Star Wars fabric, masters the concept of non-gendered clothing. I love it. I only regret that I don't speak a word of Khmer to ask if aside from appeal as colorful illustrations, she has any concept of who the cartoons are. Just how far has Western culture penetrated here? On one hand, Justin Timberlake serenaded me with his latest hit in the Pencil supermarket. On the other, I said the word "Snooki" and got zero flicker of recognition. I wonder where these fabrics came from? My best guess is they are cast offs from the many garment factories that supply countless Western brands such as H&M, Gap and Nike.
