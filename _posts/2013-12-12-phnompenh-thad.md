Thad, wearing an Angry Birds shirt matched up smartly with a skirt sewn from alternating swatches of Hello Kitty and Star Wars fabric, masters the concept of non-gendered clothing. I love it. I only regret that I don't speak a word of Khmer, and couldnâ€™t ask if, aside from their appeal as colorful illustrations, she has any concept of who the cartoons are. Just how far has Western culture penetrated here? On one hand, Justin Timberlake serenaded me with his latest hit in Pencil Supermarket. On the other, I said the word "Snooki" and got no flicker of recognition. I wonder where these fabrics came from? My best guess is they are cast-offs from the many garment factories that supply Western brands such as H&M, Gap and Nike.
