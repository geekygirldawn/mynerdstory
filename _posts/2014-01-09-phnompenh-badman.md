Before we get started, the first thing you need to know is I'm safe. This story happened over a month ago and I've waited till I'm on the plane out of Cambodia to publish this. At this time this happened, I consulted with several friends who have been in much worse scrapes than this to make sure I was taking appropriate precautions. We'll omit names and locations and any other identifying details just in case.

A boisterous asshole sidled up to the bar, inquiring in an Eastern bloc accent seasoned with five decades of tobacco "Are you one of those Americans who would be angry if I smoked." In the words of my wise friend, Jessica, "Welcome to international work. It is fraught with weirdos, wackos and some scary individuals." I've hit my halfway point of this journey, six weeks down, six more weeks to go and I'm just now running into someone fitting that description. I replied "Sit down, have a cigarette and tell me a story." A familiar voice in my head was gleefully shrieking "I am going to have the best story to tell out of this!"

Seeing my smile, he ventured that all the boys liked its two crooked incisors. This was one observant and charming weirdo. True, more than one man has gasped their objection when I mentioned getting those teeth straightened. Second, he said “You’re skinny, but not too skinny.” No doubt, he didn’t mean @skinny but it did contribute an amused lilt to my voice as I replied “You’re right.” Then he was taken with my hair, declaring that I had the best short haircut he'd seen on a woman in twenty years, and enlisting the agreement from the patrons of the bar seated near us. This man's man who later showed me his permit to carry a glock was now giggling as he touched his own wavy grey locks and proclaiming Frenchmen to be the best hairdressers anywhere.

Darkness descended with the second cocktail. What I hoped would be a funny asshole whose bark was bigger than his bite turned out to be a nasty combination of bully and bigot. He raged at the bar staff for bringing only one cocktail napkin instead of two. He bragged that in his youth he'd killed people for fun. I asked what he does for fun these days. "It's boring now." He said I was an American cow that looked old. In a calm tone he reassured me that he "wouldn't keep you for myself. I'd sell you." Oh wow, this is good information for me to know. How did we fall so fast off that cliff? I'm still kicking myself for not asking how much he thought he could get for my smart mouth.

Than didn't scare me visibly, so then he moved onto threatening to revoke my visa, effective immediately. Fantastic. "That's fine, I'm happy to go back home now. I like it there." He demanded "Now that I've bought you a drink, when I come back from the toilet you will tell me who you really are. Are you a journalist? A CIA?"

By this point, I was desperate for an exit path. In the counting seconds after he left the room, one of the staff ran over, grabbed my arm, and asked "What do you want to do? He's not a nice man. He's a bad man." I said I wanted to pay my bill before he returned from the bathroom. They ushered me out the side door into the garden to wait while the credit card slip printed. I signed and jumped into a waiting motorcycle taxi. I rode back to my apartment with head ducked below the seat, occasionally glancing behind me to see if any black SUVs were following.

Friends who should know assured me that if he was a REALLY bad man, they would've put me in a car and taken me to safety. Nobody wants the international PR scandal a disappeared American would bring. There is a US Consulate right in the middle of town. I am viscerally conscious and grateful of the protection my status as an American affords.

That voice in my head was right, I got my great story. In my long history of talking to strangers, there have been few that have ended as badly as this. Lesson learned – don't give your business card to charming assholes, not even if you think it might help prove you're a nerd and not a CIA. You might end up pilfering through their Louis Vuitton wallet later while they're otherwise occupied to retrieve it.
