It's still hard for me to go up and introduce myself to someone. I'm afraid my awkward explanation that I want to take their photo will be an insult somehow. I'm scared they won't speak a word of English. I'm scared they will and they'll simply walk away. I can still remember some of the faces that did refuse, but mostly I remember the ones I didn't have the courage to talk to – the red-haired woman with a killer print dress standing next to a graffiti rollup door – the policeman sitting in a plastic chair on the sidewalk mysteriously holding an orange balloon. 

Fortunately though, I draw the curiosity of strangers while I'm busy taking forty-seven pictures of the same thing, trying to frame up some detail of the surrounding just so. That's what happened with Tom. Unbeknownst to me, he studied me as I perched ridiculously in the grass to get a low-angle shot of the pack of street dogs that had camped out in a dirt pit in front of the pagoda. He inquired about where I was from and the usual pleasantries. He and his mother were visiting Chiang Mai from Bangkok and had made the trip especially to come to this very temple for a blessing. He even gave me his own paper map and jotted down suggestions for what other attractions I should explore. I finally gathered my courage and asked if I could take his photo. 

Thank you Thanom, aka Tom. You have a great face. I hope your mother found what she was looking for.
