This, gentlemen, is a gentleman or perhaps more accurately, a ladyboy. The "free" cabaret show at the night market in Chiang Mai requires the purchase of one drink. I made it a pi√±a colada. The ladies were whooping with delight as they danced. In the second song I looked around and verified that no one else had big tears rolling down their face, already filling up their cocktail napkin and now soaking into their shirt collars. I was afraid someone would think something had seriously gone sideways for me. No, it was only that I was overwhelmed with joy that I was here, witnessing the pure beauty of people doing something that made them happy and a society that says that is ok by them.
